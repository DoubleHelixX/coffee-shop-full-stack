### Test using the Post man collection within the POSTMAN_COLLECTION folder.
I changed the Patch failure error code to be 403 instead of 401 and gave it a body as we should be testing if a barista can have access to creating or updating drinks - a 401 will only resort true if there is no header.

I am unsure if I should provide you the email and passwords for the required Auth0 login and or if I should enable access to you?

The documentation read me is in the starter_code folder athough I didn't document the expected endpoints as the Postman collection declares what to expect and I did not see it within the rubric so I wasn't sure. However, I will do so soon.
